  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>This website will talk about SGBV (Sexual and Gender Based Violence).</p>
  <p> Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) is violence committed against a person because of his or her sex or gender. It is forcing another person to do something against his or her will through violence, coercion, threats, deception, cultural expectations, or economic means. Although the majority of victims and survivors of SGBV are girls and women, boys and men can also be harmed by SGBV. </p>

    <h4>Symptoms</h4>
    <p>A child who's being abused may feel guilty, ashamed or confused. The child may be afraid to tell anyone about the abuse, especially if the abuser is a parent, other relative or family friend. That's why it's vital to watch for red flags, such as:</p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Withdrawal from friends or usual activities</li>
    <li>Changes in behavior such as aggression, anger, hostility or hyperactivity or changes in school performance</li>

    <li>Self-harm or attempts at suicide</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Specific signs and symptoms depend on the type of abuse and can vary. Keep in mind that warning signs are just that-warning signs. The presence of warning signs doesn't necessarily mean that a child is being abused.</p>

    <h3>3. Domestic Violence</h3>
    <p><b>What Is Domestic Abuse?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Domestic abuse, also called "domestic violence" or "intimate partner violence", can be defined as a pattern of behavior in any relationship that is used to gain or maintain power and control over an intimate partner.</li>
        <li>Abuse is physical, sexual, emotional, economic or psychological actions or threats of actions that influence another person. This includes any behaviors that frighten, intimidate, terrorize, manipulate, hurt, humiliate, blame, injure, or wound someone.</li>
        <li>Domestic abuse can happen to anyone of any race, age, sexual orientation, religion, or gender.</li>
        <li>It can occur within a range of relationships including couples who are married, living together or dating.</li>
        <li>Domestic violence affects people of all socioeconomic backgrounds and education levels.</li>
        <li>Anyone can be a victim of domestic violence, regardless of age, race, gender, sexual orientation, faith or class</li>
        <li>Victims of domestic abuse may also include a child or other relative, or any other household member.</li>
        <li>Domestic abuse is typically manifested as a pattern of abusive behavior toward an intimate partner in a dating or family relationship, where the abuser exerts power and control over the victim.</li>
        <li>Domestic abuse can be mental, physical, economic or sexual in nature. Incidents are rarely isolated, and usually escalate in frequency and severity. Domestic abuse may culminate in serious physical injury or death.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Recognizing the signs of domestic abuse</b>
      <br><b>Does your partner...</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Embarrass or make fun of you in front of your friends or family?</li>
        <li>Put down your accomplishments?</li>
        <li>Make you feel like you are unable to make decisions?</li>
        <li>Use intimidation or threats to gain compliance?</li>
        <li>Tell you that you are nothing without them?</li>
        <li>Treat you roughly—grab, push, pinch, shove or hit you?</li>
        <li>Call you several times a night or show up to make sure you are where you said you would be?</li>
        <li>Use drugs or alcohol as an excuse for saying hurtful things or abusing you?</li>
        <li>Blame you for how they feel or act?</li>
        <li>Pressure you sexually for things you aren’t ready for?</li>
        <li>Make you feel like there is “no way out” of the relationship?</li>
        <li>Prevent you from doing things you want – like spending time with friends or family?</li>
        <li>Try to keep you from leaving after a fight or leave you somewhere after a fight to “teach you a lesson”?</li>
        <br>
        <br><b>Do you...</b>
        <li>Sometimes feel scared of how your partner may behave?</li>
        <li>Constantly make excuses to other people for your partner’s behaviour?</li>
        <li>Believe that you can help your partner change if only you changed something about yourself?</li>
        <li>Try not to do anything that would cause conflict or make your partner angry?</li>
        <li>Always do what your partner wants you to do instead of what you want?</li>
        <li>Stay with your partner because you are afraid of what your partner would do if you broke up?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>If any of these things are happening in your relationship, talk to someone. Without help, the abuse will continue. Making that first call to seek help is a courageous step.
      <br>
      <br><b><i>Always remember, NO ONE deserves to be abused. The abuse is not your fault. You are not alone.</i></b>
      <br>
      <br>Physical and sexual assaults, or threats to commit them, are the most apparent forms of domestic abuse and violence and are usually the actions that allow others to become aware of the problem.
      <br>
      <br><b>Emotional abuse:</b> includes undermining a person's sense of self-worth through constant criticism; belittling one's abilities; name-calling or other verbal abuse. You may be in an emotionally abusive relationship if your partner:
      <ul>
        <li>Calls you names, insults you or continually criticizes you.</li>
        <li>Does not trust you and acts in a jealous or possessive manner.</li>
        <li>Tries to isolate you from family or friends.</li>
        <li>Monitors where you go, whom you call and with whom you spend your time.</li>
        <li>Does not want you to work.</li>
        <li>Controls finances or refuses to share money.</li>
        <li>Punishes you by withholding affection.</li>
        <li>Expects you to ask permission.</li>
        <li>Threatens to hurt you, the children, your family or your pets.</li>
        <li>Humiliates you in any way.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Physical abuse:</b>involves hurting or trying to hurt a partner by hitting, kicking, burning, grabbing, pinching, shoving, slapping, hair-pulling, biting, denying medical care or forcing alcohol and/or drug use, or using other physical force. You may be in a physically abusive relationship if your partner:
        <br><ul>
          <li>Damages property when angry (throws objects, punches walls, kicks doors, etc.).</li>
          <li>Pushes, slaps, bites, kicks or chokes you.</li>
          <li>Abandons you in a dangerous or unfamiliar place.</li>
          <li>Scares you by driving recklessly.</li>
          <li>Uses a weapon to threaten or hurt you.</li>
          <li>Forces you to leave your home.</li>
          <li>Traps you in your home or keeps you from leaving.</li>
          <li>Prevents you from calling police or seeking medical attention.</li>
          <li>Hurts your children</li>
          <li>Uses physical force in sexual situations.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <h3>4. Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)</h3>
    <p>Female genital mutilation (FGM) refers to “all procedures involving partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.”
      <br>
      <br>While the exact number of girls and women worldwide who have undergone FGM remains unknown, at least 200 million girls and women have been cut in 31 countries.
      <br>According to available data from 30 countries where FGM is practiced in the western, eastern, and north-eastern regions of Africa, and some countries in the Middle East and Asia, more than 200 million girls and women alive today have been subjected to the practice with more than 3 million girls estimated to be at risk of FGM annually. FGM is therefore of global concern.
      <br>The reasons why FGM is performed vary from one region to another as well as over time and include a mix of sociocultural factors within families and communities.
      <ul>
        <li>FGM is a social convention (social norm), the social pressure to conform to what others do and have been doing, as well as the need to be accepted socially and the fear of being rejected by the community, are strong motivations to perpetuate the practice.</li>
        <li>FGM is often considered a necessary part of raising a girl, and a way to prepare her for adulthood and marriage. This can include controlling her sexuality to promote premarital virginity and marital fidelity.</li>
        <li>Some people believe that the practice has religious support, although no religious scripts prescribe the practice. Religious leaders take varying positions with regard to FGM, with some contributing to its abandonment.</li>
      </ul>
      <br><b>Reasons for medicalized FGM</b>
      <br>There are many reasons why health-care providers perform FGM. These include:
      <ul>
        <li>the belief that there is reduced risk of complications associated with medicalized FGM as compared to non-medicalized FGM</li>
        <li>the belief that medicalization of FGM could be a first step towards full abandonment of the practice</li>
        <li>health care providers who perform FGM are themselves members of FGM- practising communities and are subject to the same social norms</li>
        <li>there may be a financial incentive to perform the practice</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <br><b>Types of FGM</b>
      <ol>
        <li> This is the partial or total removal of the clitoral glans (the external and visible part of the clitoris, which is a sensitive part of the female genitals), and/or the prepuce/clitoral hood (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoral glands).</li>
        <li>This is the partial or total removal of the clitoral glans and the labia minora (the inner folds of the vulva), with or without removal of the labia majora (the outer folds of skin of the vulva).</li>
        <li>Also known as infibulation, this is the narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora, sometimes through stitching, with or without removal of the clitoral prepuce/clitoral hood and glands.</li>
        <li>This includes all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g., pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterizing the genital area.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <br>FGM has no health benefits. Immediate complications of FGM can include:
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>severe pain</li>
        <li>excessive bleeding (haemorrhage)</li>
        <li>genital tissue swelling</li>
        <li>fever</li>
        <li>infections e.g., tetanus</li>
        <li>urinary problems</li>
        <li>wound healing problems</li>
        <li>injury to surrounding genital tissue</li>
        <li>shock</li>
        <li>death</li>
      </ul>
      <br>Long-term complications can include:
      <ul>
        <li>urinary problems (painful urination, urinary tract infections)</li>
        <li>vaginal problems (discharge, itching, bacterial vaginosis and other infections)</li>
        <li>menstrual problems (painful menstruations, difficulty in passing menstrual blood, etc.)</li>
        <li>scar tissue and keloid</li>
        <li>sexual problems (pain during intercourse, decreased satisfaction, etc.)</li>
        <li>increased risk of childbirth complications (difficult delivery, excessive bleeding, caesarean section, need to resuscitate the baby, etc.) and newborn deaths</li>
        <li>need for later surgeries: for example, the sealing or narrowing of the vaginal opening (type 3) may lead to the practice of cutting open the sealed vagina later to allow for sexual intercourse and childbirth (deinfibulation). Sometimes genital tissue is stitched again several times, including after childbirth, hence the woman goes through repeated opening and closing procedures, further increasing both immediate and long-term risks</li>
        <li>psychological problems (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, low self-esteem, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>5. Psychological Abuse</h3>
    <p>Psychological abuse: involves causing fear by intimidation; threatening physical harm to self, partner or children; destruction of pets and property; “mind games”; or forcing isolation from friends, family, school and/or work.
      <br><b>Signs of Psychological Abuse</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Being visibly upset or agitated</li>
        <li>Being withdrawn and unresponsive</li>
        <li>Avoiding certain people or being scared, nervous, or timid around them</li>
        <li>Behaving in unusual ways, such as rocking, biting, or sucking</li>
        <li>Starting to cancel plans at the last minute</li>
        <li>Making excuses for the partner's hurtful words or behaviors</li>
        <li>Being more quiet when the partner is around</li>
        <li>Being overly apologetic</li>
        <li>Appearing to be more indecisive and insecure</li>
        <li>Feeling rushed all the time</li>
        <li>Constantly checking the phone/partner is constantly checking in</li>
      </ul>
      <br><b>Types of Psychological Abuse</b>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Intimidation</b> - to frighten or threaten someone, usually in order to persuade the person to do something he or she does not wish to do</li>
        <li><b>Coercion</b> - the act or process of persuading someone forcefully to do something that they do not want to do</li>
        <li><b>Bullying</b> - the behaviour of a person who hurts or frightens someone smaller or less powerful, often forcing that person to do something they do not want</li>
        <li><b>Ridicule</b> - mock or make fun of someone</li>
        <li><b>Humiliation</b> - the feeling when someone has deliberately done something to put you down or make you look bad in the eyes of others</li>
        <li><b>Gaslighting</b> - to gaslight someone means to manipulate another person into doubting their own perceptions, experiences or understanding of events</li>

        <li><b>Infantilization</b> - the prolonged treatment of one who is not a child, as though they are a child</li>
        <li><b>Isolation</b> - restricting a person's contact with family and friends or physically confining a person</li>
        <li><b>Silence</b> - to silence someone is to hush him up or tell him to be quiet. Silence also has a more disturbing meaning: if someone threatens you to keep you from saying something, she's trying to silence you.</li>
        <li><b>Control</b> - a controlling relationship is one where one person exerts control over their partner, monitoring and dictating different aspects of their life, such as their finances, social life, and even appearance</li>

        <li>Trouble sleeping</li>
        <li>Eating disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia</li>
        <li>Mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and difficulty regulating emotions</li>

      </ul>
      <br><b>These are some examples of psychological intimate partner abuse:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Wanting to know what you’re doing, where you are, and who you’re with at all times</li>
        <li>Expecting you to be in constant contact or checking up on your whereabouts</li>
        <li>Wanting the passwords to your phone, email address, and social media accounts to track your digital activity</li>
        <li>Monitoring your spending habits and controlling your finances</li>
        <li>Getting jealous and frequently accusing you of cheating on them</li>

        <li>Getting angry and abusive in ways that are frightening to you</li>
        <li>Swearing at you, calling you names, or treating you like a child</li>
        <li>Ridiculing you or humiliating you in front of others</li>
        <li>Threatening you or your loved ones with bodily harm</li>
        <li>Threatening you with police or legal action, often for made-up reasons</li>
        <li>Threatening to hurt themselves when they’re upset with you as a way of manipulating you and controlling your behavior</li>
        <li>Telling you things like, “If I can’t have you, no one can.”</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <P><b>Coping With Psychological Abuse:</b>
      <ol>
        <li>Recognize the problem: The first step, which can sometimes be the hardest, is recognizing that you’re being abused. For instance, you may think, “But, my parent/partner has always behaved this way.” Learn what are healthy relationship dynamics and start seeing unhealthy behaviors for what they are.</li>
        <li>Leave the abusive situation: If you are in an abusive situation, it’s important to create a safety plan and leave as soon as you can. Seek help from trusted friends, family members, neighbors, law enforcement, or organizations if you need it.</li>
        <li>Maintain a record of the abuse: Your abuser may gaslight you by saying, “I never said that,” which can cause you to doubt yourself and question your reality. It can be helpful to write down all the details of the abusive situations so you have a record of what really transpired.</li>
        <li>Don’t engage your abuser: If you come face-to-face with your abuser, don’t give them the satisfaction of reacting to them. Learn to set firm boundaries and refuse to engage with them.</li>
        <li>Remember that you’re not to blame: Remind yourself repeatedly that you are not to blame for being abused. You do not deserve to be abused, and you have not caused the abuse.</li>
        <li>Work on healthy relationships: It’s important to develop self-awareness and distinguish between healthy and unhealthy behaviors, across different types of relationships to break the cycle of abuse. It may be difficult to trust people or let yourself be vulnerable, but those are important components of healthy relationships with mutual respect, trust, and affection.</li>
        <li>Seek help: There is no shame in seeking therapy to help you cope. Therapy can help you process your emotions, develop coping skills, build self-esteem, and heal from the trauma.</li>
        <li>Join a support group: Support groups can help you voice your abuse amongst people who have had similar experiences. They can be a source of support, inspiration, and advice.</li>
      </ol>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am going to talk about SGBV (Sexual and Gender Based Violence).</p>
  <p> Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) is violence committed against a person because of his or her sex or gender. It is forcing another person to do something against his or her will through violence, coercion, threats, deception, cultural expectations, or economic means. Although the majority of victims and survivors of SGBV are girls and women, boys and men can also be harmed by SGBV. </p>

    </ol></p>
    
    <h4>Symptoms</h4>
    <p>A child who's being abused may feel guilty, ashamed or confused. The child may be afraid to tell anyone about the abuse, especially if the abuser is a parent, other relative or family friend. That's why it's vital to watch for red flags, such as:</p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Withdrawal from friends or usual activities</li>
    <li>Changes in behavior such as aggression, anger, hostility or hyperactivity or changes in school performance</li>
    <li>Depression, anxiety or unusual fears, or a sudden loss of self-confidence</li>
    <li>Sleep problems and nightmares</li>
    <li>An apparent lack of supervision</li>
    <li>Frequent absences from school</li>
    <li>Rebellious or defiant behavior</li>
    <li>Self-harm or attempts at suicide</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Specific signs and symptoms depend on the type of abuse and can vary. Keep in mind that warning signs are just that-warning signs. The presence of warning signs doesn't necessarily mean that a child is being abused.</p>
    
    <h4>Physical abuse signs and symptoms</h4>
<p><ul>
    <li>Unexplained injuries, such as bruises, broken bones (fractures) or burns</li>

    <li>Injuries that aren't compatible with the child's developmental ability</li>
</ul>
</p>

    </ul>
</p>

<h4>Warning signs include a parent who:</h4>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shows little concern for the child</li>
    <li>Appears unable to recognize physical or emotional distress in the child</li>
    <li>Blames the child for the problems</li>
    <li>Consistently belittles or berates the child, and describes the child with negative terms, such as "worthless" or "evil"</li>

    <h3>3. Domestic Violence</h3>
    <p><b>What Is Domestic Abuse?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Domestic abuse, also called "domestic violence" or "intimate partner violence", can be defined as a pattern of behavior in any relationship that is used to gain or maintain power and control over an intimate partner.</li>
        <li>Abuse is physical, sexual, emotional, economic or psychological actions or threats of actions that influence another person. This includes any behaviors that frighten, intimidate, terrorize, manipulate, hurt, humiliate, blame, injure, or wound someone.</li>
        <li>Domestic abuse can happen to anyone of any race, age, sexual orientation, religion, or gender.</li>
        <li>It can occur within a range of relationships including couples who are married, living together or dating.</li>
        <li>Domestic violence affects people of all socioeconomic backgrounds and education levels.</li>
        <li>Anyone can be a victim of domestic violence, regardless of age, race, gender, sexual orientation, faith or class</li>
        <li>Victims of domestic abuse may also include a child or other relative, or any other household member.</li>
        <li>Domestic abuse is typically manifested as a pattern of abusive behavior toward an intimate partner in a dating or family relationship, where the abuser exerts power and control over the victim.</li>
        <li>Domestic abuse can be mental, physical, economic or sexual in nature. Incidents are rarely isolated, and usually escalate in frequency and severity. Domestic abuse may culminate in serious physical injury or death.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Recognizing the signs of domestic abuse</b>
      <br><b>Does your partner...</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Embarrass or make fun of you in front of your friends or family?</li>
        <li>Put down your accomplishments?</li>
        <li>Make you feel like you are unable to make decisions?</li>
        <li>Use intimidation or threats to gain compliance?</li>
        <li>Tell you that you are nothing without them?</li>
        <li>Treat you roughly—grab, push, pinch, shove or hit you?</li>
        <li>Call you several times a night or show up to make sure you are where you said you would be?</li>
        <li>Use drugs or alcohol as an excuse for saying hurtful things or abusing you?</li>
        <li>Blame you for how they feel or act?</li>
        <li>Pressure you sexually for things you aren’t ready for?</li>
        <li>Make you feel like there is “no way out” of the relationship?</li>
        <li>Prevent you from doing things you want – like spending time with friends or family?</li>
        <li>Try to keep you from leaving after a fight or leave you somewhere after a fight to “teach you a lesson”?</li>
        <br>
        <br><b>Do you...</b>
        <li>Sometimes feel scared of how your partner may behave?</li>
        <li>Constantly make excuses to other people for your partner’s behaviour?</li>
        <li>Believe that you can help your partner change if only you changed something about yourself?</li>
        <li>Try not to do anything that would cause conflict or make your partner angry?</li>
        <li>Always do what your partner wants you to do instead of what you want?</li>
        <li>Stay with your partner because you are afraid of what your partner would do if you broke up?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>If any of these things are happening in your relationship, talk to someone. Without help, the abuse will continue. Making that first call to seek help is a courageous step.
      <br><b><i>Always remember, NO ONE deserves to be abused. The abuse is not your fault. You are not alone.</i></b>

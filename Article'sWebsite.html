  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am going to talk about SGBV (Sexual and Gender Based Violence).</p>
  <p> Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) is violence committed against a person because of his or her sex or gender. It is forcing another person to do something against his or her will through violence, coercion, threats, deception, cultural expectations, or economic means. Although the majority of victims and survivors of SGBV are girls and women, boys and men can also be harmed by SGBV. </p>

    <h3>Types of SGBV</h3>
    <p>

        <br>2. Child Abuse
        <br>3. Domestic Violence

    <h3>1. Sexual Abuse/Harassment</h3>
    <p>Sexual abuse is a form of sexual violence, which includes sexual assault, such as rape or unwanted touching, and sexual harassment, which is unwelcome, intimidating or offensive sexual behavior.</p>
        <br>Examples of sexual violence:
        <br>-Being spoken to in a sexual way that you find offensive or degrading
        <br>-Repeated unwanted sexual attention or advances, including in your workplace or by your employer

    </p>

  <div>
    <h3>2. Child Abuse/Neglect</h3>
    <p>Any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation</p>
    <p>An act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm</p>
    <h4>Symptoms</h4>
    <p>A child who's being abused may feel guilty, ashamed or confused. The child may be afraid to tell anyone about the abuse, especially if the abuser is a parent, other relative or family friend. That's why it's vital to watch for red flags, such as:</p>
    <p><br> *Withdrawal from friends or usual activities
    <br>*Changes in behavior such as aggression, anger, hostility or hyperactivity or changes in school performance
    <br>*Depression, anxiety or unusual fears, or a sudden loss of self-confidence
    <br>*Sleep problems and nightmares
    <br>*An apparent lack of supervision
    <br>*Frequent absences from school
    <br>*Rebellious or defiant behavior
    <br>*Self-harm or attempts at suicide
    </p>
    <p>Specific signs and symptoms depend on the type of abuse and can vary. Keep in mind that warning signs are just that-warning signs. The presence of warning signs doesn't necessarily mean that a child is being abused.</p>
    <h4>Physical abuse signs and symptoms</h4>
<p>
    <br>*Unexplained injuries, such as bruises, broken bones (fractures) or burns
    <br>*Injuries that don't match the given explanation
    <br>*Injuries that aren't compatible with the child's developmental ability
</p>
<h4>Sexual abuse signs and symptoms</h4>
<p>
    <br>*Sexual behavior or knowledge that's inappropriate for the child's age
    <br>*Pregnancy or a sexually transmitted infection
    <br>*Genital or anal pain, bleeding, or injury
    <br>*Statements by the child that he or she was sexually abused
    <br>*Inappropriate sexual behavior with other children
</p>
<h4>Emotional abuse signs and symptoms</h4>
<p>
    <br>*Delayed or inappropriate emotional development
    <br>*Loss of self-confidence or self-esteem
    <br>*Social withdrawal or a loss of interest or enthusiasm
    <br>*Depression
    <br>*Avoidance of certain situations, such as refusing to go to school or ride the bus
    <br>*Appears to desperately seek affection
    <br>*A decrease in school performance or loss of interest in school
    <br>*Loss of previously acquired developmental skills
</p>
<h4>Neglect signs and symptoms</h4>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Poor growth</li>
    <li>Excessive weight with medical complications that are not being adequately addressed</li>
    <li>Poor personal cleanliness</li>
    <li>Lack of clothing or supplies to meet physical needs</li>
    <li>Hoarding or stealing food</li>
    <li>Poor record of school attendance</li>
    <li>Lack of appropriate attention for medical, dental or psychological problems or lack of necessary follow-up care</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h4>Warning signs include a parent who:</h4>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shows little concern for the child</li>
    <li>Appears unable to recognize physical or emotional distress in the child</li>
    <li>Blames the child for the problems</li>
    <li>Consistently belittles or berates the child, and describes the child with negative terms, such as "worthless" or "evil"</li>
    <li>Expects the child to provide attention and care to the parent and seems jealous of other family members getting attention from the child</li>
    <li>Uses harsh physical discipline</li>
    <li>Demands an inappropriate level of physical or academic performance</li>
    <li>Severely limits the child's contact with others</li>
    <li>Offers conflicting or unconvincing explanations for a child's injuries or no explanation at all</li>
    <li>Repeatedly brings the child for medical evaluations or requests medical tests, such as X-rays and lab tests, for concerns not seen during the health care provider's examination</li>
    </ul>
